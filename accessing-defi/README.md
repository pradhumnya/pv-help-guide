# Accessing DeFi

**DeFi Access Introduction**

DApp access in PrimeVault is supported via PrimeVaultâ€™s Chrome Browser Extension which can be installed in the Chrome Web Store.

**How to access DeFi protocols**&#x20;

* Download PrimeVault extension
* Log into your extension
* Whitelist a DApp
* Conduct a DApp transaction
* View a DApp transaction
* Approve a DApp transaction

### Download PrimeVault extension

1. Download PrimeVault in Google Chrome Web Store: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/primevault/fgmfmeoikkgpemaocbmjlkhcpcjfobkf](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/primevault/fgmfmeoikkgpemaocbmjlkhcpcjfobkf)
2. **Please restart chrome** once you've downloaded the app
3. Authenticate the extension before connecting to a DApp
4. Disable your Metamask to enable the best experience (since we use similar channels and some DApps are unable to distinguish between Metamask and PrimeVault)
5. Use the native PrimeVault extension (recommended) or WalletConnect to connect with the DApp
6. Whitelist DApp before interacting with the DApp

### Whitelist a DApp

Your workspace Admins can whitelist dApps on supported chains in their PrimeVault web app.

1. Log into your PrimeVault app in a browser (Chrome recommended). Go to DApps > Directory tab and click on the 'Whitelist New DApp' button. Some trusted DApps have already been whitelisted by PrimeVault and you can begin using them instantly&#x20;
2. Add Name, URL, and category for the DApp you would like to whitelist. Your request will be sent across the organization for approvals based on your policies
3. You can manually add contracts using '+ Add New Contract' within DApps where you would like to skip risk scoring from PrimeVault&#x20;
4. Your organization approvers will receive a mobile notification to approve the DApp before you can begin using it. Once approved by your admins, you can begin using the DApp

2. Approve the transaction on your mobile device
