# DeFi for Near Ecosystem

Accessing the Near ecosystem has a slightly different experience versus other ecosystems - please read the page below to understand why you may notice your experience is different when using a Near DApp (Ref Finance)

### Transaction Failure message

Every time you use the Ref Finance app, you will notice that the Ref Finance app throws an error message "transaction failed" - however this does not mean your transaction failed.&#x20;

For checking the finality of the transaction please refer to the transaction table in PrimeVault and block explorers on Near&#x20;

The reason you see the failed transaction is that PrimeVault has disallowed Ref Finance full access to your vault to enhance security: 1) the DApp arbitrarily cannot act on your behalf and 2) organization policies are applied to your DApp interaction which prevents a single point of failure &#x20;

### Slower Speeds (Near RPC Provider)

Sometimes you may notice that transactions take longer than expected. This is because the RPC provider used by the DApp takes 1000+ms to act on a transaction. In case you're experiencing slower than usual speeds - please look at the bottom right corner of Ref finance app to see what speed the RPC provider is operating at and wait for the transaction to go through

### Limit Orders on Ref Finance

Success notification when placing a limit order on Ref Finance means that the quote for the price has been entered on the blockchain - it does not mean that the limit order has been executed. Please check the Ref Finance dashboard for the finality of transaction execution

### Tracking DeFi positions&#x20;

Track your position on Ref Finance's portfolio page using the tabs - Overview and Ref.Finance . You can track your positions on PrimeVault's dashboard page or DApp page as well (however DCL positions and price of xRef cannot be tracked currently)
