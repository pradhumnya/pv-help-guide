# Whitelisting an address

**Address whitelisting Introduction**

This in-product flow authorizes org admins to whitelist external addresses (trade counterparties, external company wallets etc.) that users in the org are allowed to interact with (send funds to). This, together with spend controls at the Vault level, prevent internal attack vectors such as a compromised or a malicious user siphoning funds out of secure vaults.

**How to whitelist an address**

* Understanding your Address Dashboard
* Add an Address&#x20;
* Approve an Address

### **Understanding your Address Dashboard**

1. Select ‘+New Contact’ from the right side of the platform
