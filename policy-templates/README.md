# Policy Templates

For selected customers, we are rolling out Policy Templates. With policy templates, you can set up different templates, each with a set of signers and viewers. Additionally, these templates retain the same set of policies that previously were part of the vault setup. A template can be attached to any number of vaults.

> If you are an existing customer, your account will have some templates that are migrated from existing vault policies.
