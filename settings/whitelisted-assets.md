# Whitelisted Assets

### Viewing Whitelisted Assets

To view your current list of whitelisted assets:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Whitelisted Assets**.
2. You’ll see a table of tokens already approved for use.
3. You can filter tokens by name, symbol, or chain using the search bar and dropdown menu.

### Adding a Custom Token

You can now whitelist custom tokens that are not part of the default list by following these steps:

1. Click on the **+ Custom Asset** button on the top-right corner.
2. In the side panel that opens:
   * **Select Chain**: Choose the blockchain on which the token resides.
   * **Enter Contract Address**: Paste the token’s verified smart contract address from a trusted block explorer (e.g., [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [Blockscan](https://blockscan.com/), etc.).
3. Click **Review Asset** to validate the address.
4. If the token contract is valid, the asset will be added to your organization's whitelist.

> **Note:** Only verified and trusted token addresses should be added. Whitelisting a malicious or incorrect token address can compromise security and interfere with transaction processes.
