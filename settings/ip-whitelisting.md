# IP Whitelisting

#### Adding an IP Address

To whitelist an IP:

1. Navigate to **Settings > IP Whitelist**.
2. Click on **Add IP Address**.
3. Enter the IP address of the server that should be allowed API access.
4. Save to apply the restriction.

Only whitelisted IPs will be permitted to interact with your API, adding an extra layer of security.

> **Note:** Use static IPs for reliability. Dynamic IPs may lead to failed API requests.
