# Setting up Vaults

### [Core Vault](core-vaults.md)

Multi-chain and multi-asset segregated, non-custodial vaults with (deposit / wallet) addresses on each chain to manage digital assets, conduct token treasury operations and manage DeFi investments and trading as a team

### [Exchange Vault](exchange-vaults.md)

Connect your Exchange trading accounts in PrimeVault and provision necessary access controls to admins to move funds between Core Vaults and Exchanges. Automate Vault-to-Exchange and Exchange-to-Exchange transfers.&#x20;

* Note an Exchange Vault is a custodial Vault where the funds are in your Exchange’s custody.&#x20;
* The Vault in PrimeVault provides a permissioned framework to interact with assets sitting on linked Exchanges and enables single-window administration of funds across Exchanges

### [Gas Vault](gas-vaults.md)

A gas vault is a non-custodial “gas tank” that is configured by default to monitor gas token balance in each Core Vault (on all chains) and automatically replenishes a vault when token balance falls below threshold.



### <mark style="color:blue;">Network For Your Vault</mark>

Select the desired network for your vault: Testnet or Mainnet. If you select the Testnet option, an arbitrum-testnet wallet will be created by default.
