# Multi-Entity Support

PrimeVault supports **multi-entity login**, allowing users to manage multiple workspaces on the same mobile device using different accounts. This feature is particularly useful for individuals handling multiple workspaces while ensuring notifications and activities remain workspace-specific.

### How Multi-Entity Support Works

* Users can **log in to multiple workspaces** with different accounts.
* Each workspace requires a **separate alias** (unique account login) to maintain workspace independence.
* Notifications for transactions and operations are **workspace-specific**, meaning you will receive alerts **only for the currently active workspace**.

#### **Notifications Behavior**

* You will receive notifications **only for the active workspace** on the mobile device.
* Switching to another workspace ensures that alerts from the previous workspace do not interfere.
